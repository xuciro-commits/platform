# Work Queue

The only list of active platform work. Each item: goal, boundary, done-when, status. When an item is done, delete it (git history keeps it) and fold lasting knowledge into `docs/Platform.md`. Music product work lives in the MSRU repository's `Docs/WorkQueue.md`.

| # · Status | Task | Done when |
|---|---|---|
| **97 · ready** | Platform operations, one deep step (ADR-0010 part 2 rows marked later): server-side work (K9) for scheduled jobs and asynchronous event delivery with retries; connectors managed in Settings (health, cursor, last error, enable); in-app notifications from events; typed per-app settings in Settings; notifications addressed to units (ADR-0012) | Manufacturing's connectors are managed from Settings; an event handler that fails is retried as owned work and shows its state; a supervisor is notified of a new downtime event |

## Open friction (temporary; delete entries once resolved)

| ID | Domain | Kind | Observation | Resolution path |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| F-22 | Composition | limit (K4 C3) | Causation cannot name a change in another package's log; the bridge derives the hotel's idempotency key from its own and puts its key in the correlation ID | Keep derived keys unless audit needs cross-log causation; then a contract rule with vectors |
| F-3 | Music | missing (K1) | Music routes never address a specific entity (the platform shell's routes now do, and references cross Go, Rust and TypeScript) | Music adopts entity routes (MSRU) |
| F-4 | Music | mapping (K8) | Source capabilities are a music-specific bitmask (`SourceCapabilities`), and Subsonic keeps its own `LibraryCapabilities` projected onto it | Now that K8 exists: describe Subsonic and watched folders as K8 poll connectors (MSRU) |
