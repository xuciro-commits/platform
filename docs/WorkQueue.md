# Work Queue

The only list of active platform work. Each item: goal, boundary, done-when, status. When an item is done, delete it (git history keeps it) and fold lasting knowledge into `docs/Platform.md`. Music product work lives in the MSRU repository's `Docs/WorkQueue.md`.

| # · Status | Task | Done when |
|---|---|---|
| **106 · building** | Stage 1, the application model ([ADR-0016](ADR/0016-application-model.md), accepted D1–D8). Done: the entity kit and record store, generic reads with scope and history, the kit's list page, record page and generated forms, CRM moved (its local journal replays), Settings' records browser. Next: Hotel's room types and reservations declared, the Hotel Desk and sales views kept working | Hotel's hand-written lists and forms are gone; its journals replay; `CheckReplay` passes in every composition |
| **105 · batch 1 done, owner testing** | AI providers (ADR-0015): providers, catalogs, enabled models with access, calls with journaled usage, Settings (providers, playground, usage) | The owner has tested with OpenRouter; batch 2 (quotas and rate limits, the Anthropic adapter, app calls as effects, streaming) is ordered |

## Open friction (temporary; delete entries once resolved)

| ID | Domain | Kind | Observation | Resolution path |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| F-22 | Composition | limit (K4 C3) | Causation cannot name a change in another package's log; a protocol call (the CRM reserving a stay) derives the provider's idempotency key from the consumer's and puts the consumer's key in the correlation ID | Keep derived keys unless audit needs cross-log causation; then a contract rule with vectors |
| F-3 | Music | missing (K1) | Music routes never address a specific entity (the platform shell's routes now do, and references cross Go, Rust and TypeScript) | Music adopts entity routes (MSRU) |
| F-4 | Music | mapping (K8) | Source capabilities are a music-specific bitmask (`SourceCapabilities`), and Subsonic keeps its own `LibraryCapabilities` projected onto it | Now that K8 exists: describe Subsonic and watched folders as K8 poll connectors (MSRU) |
